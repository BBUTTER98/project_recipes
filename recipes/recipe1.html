    <p>No two aglio e olio recipes are alike, but this one is pretty true to the classic method.</p><p> The key is slowly toasting the garlic slices to a perfect golden brown in the olive oil.<br> If it's too light, you don't get the full flavor and if it's too dark it gets bitter.<br> My advice? Do it perfectly.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound uncooked spaghetti</li>
        <li>½ cup olive oil</li>
        <li>6 cloves garlic, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes, or to taste</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>¼ cup chopped fresh Italian parsley</li>
        <li>1 cup finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling<br>water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 10 to<br>12 minutes. Drain and transfer to a pasta bowl</li>
        <li>While the pasta is cooking, combine olive oil and garlic in a cold skillet. Cook<br>over medium heat to slowly toast garlic, about 10 minutes. Reduce heat to<br>medium-low when olive oil begins to bubble. Cook and stir until garlic is golden<br>brown, about another 5 minutes. Remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Stir red pepper flakes, salt, and black pepper into pasta. Pour in hot olive oil and<br>garlic, and sprinkle on Italian parsley and half of the Parmigiano-Reggianogarlic,<br> and sprinkle on Italian parsley and half of the Parmigiano-Reggiano<br>cheese; toss until combined.</li>
        <li>Serve pasta topped with the remaining Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.</li>
